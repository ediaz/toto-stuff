\title{Improving the FWI gradient trough data selection in the frequency domain}

\maketitle

In class we have seen that the gradient formulation in FWI relies on the 
Born approximation. This assumption imposes serious limitations on the velocity
models we can recover. As rule of thumb, the Born assumption is said to be broken
when the travel time misfit between observed and modeled data is bigger than
half a period. However, despite how big is the velocity perturbation to recover,
 the travel time misfit depends mostly on the source-receiver distance. 
This observation have been used by several authors  \citep{liu2014,alejo} as a QC for FWI. The basic idea in 
the data selection is to back-propagate the parts of the data that are
compliant with the Born approximation. As the model improves the mask relax more and more, 
and at the end probably most of the data can be included.

In the frequency domain the half-cycle assumption translate in a phase difference bigger 
than half-cycle $\Delta \phi > \pi$. This observation was used \cite{qa-fwi}
to QC the initial velocity models before inversion starts. They say not to start a FWI 
project if this Born conditions are not met.

In this report, I use the same criterion to identify cycle-skipped phases as \cite{qa-fwi}
does. Then, I use the magnitude of the phase difference gradient $\nabla \Delta \phi$
to create a mute mask based on the limit of the data one can use for the current model. 
 This approach should be the frequency-domain equivalent of \cite{liu2014,alejo}.

\section{Results}
 Figures~\ref{fig:truemod}-\ref{fig:vdiff} show the true velocity model, the starting model,
and the difference, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:vdiff} is the ``perfect'' update direction,
 which I use as benchmark for the different results. 

Figure~\ref{fig:phase-diff} shows the phase difference between modeled and 
observed data, measured as: $\Delta \phi = arg(d_{mod}d_{obs}^*) \in [-\pi,\pi]$ \citep{qa-fwi}.
 Figure~\ref{fig:mag} shows the magnitude of the gradient of the phase difference, where 
the gradient is defined with the source and receiver positions as follows:
\[
\nabla \Delta \phi := \partial_S\Delta\phi  \hat{S} + \partial_R \Delta\phi \hat{R}.
\]

To compute the inclusion mask, I do it automatically by setting it to 1 along the offset 
axis until I find a spike, then is 0. Then, I smooth the mask so the inclusion/rejection region
varies smoothly. The mask is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mask}.  

Figure~\ref{fig:gr-ddiff} shows the gradient computed using the direct difference as 
adjoint source. Figure~\ref{fig:gr-mddiff} shows the gradient using the data selection
approach proposed here. Figures~\ref{fig:gr-sm-ddiff}-\ref{fig:gr-sm-ddiff}
 show the smoothed versions for direct difference and data-selection approach, respectively. 

Which one is better? Our benchmark is Figure~\ref{fig:vdiff}. Without smoothing
it is hard to appreciate the direction of update, this is probably due to the ringing that
comes from the fact we are using only one frequency for the gradient $f=5Hz$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:gr-sm-mddiff} is much better for the left side 
of the model. Also, is better in the upper faulted part of the model (blue
update), whereas the conventional update extends the blue update further 
to the left.
