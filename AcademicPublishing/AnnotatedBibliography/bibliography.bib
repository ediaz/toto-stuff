      Felder and Brent outline the common issues and situations a 
      scientist faces when writing a project like an article, proposal, 
      thesis dissertation, or a book. 
      They address two main situations:  delay of the project, and 
      mixing tasks that interfere with each other. 
      
      For the first issue, they propose to commit time, even little time,
      to the project on a daily basis. This ensures the author starts writing 
      early on and not close to the deadline. 

      For the second problem, they refer specifically to the mixed 
      objectives of writing and editing. Separating the two tasks
      allows the writer to advance faster with putting the ideas up front
      into the text. Editing, also is very important and can 
      be alternated with writing in two different sessions.

      \begin{itemize}
      \item 
            This article certainly shows common issues one faces when writing, 
      and their suggestions seem very logical and helpful. 

      \item 
      The first aspect of the process is quite obvious, specially if writing 
      is not an easy process for a given author.  

      \item The second
      suggestion is very important. I do feel identified 
      with the live editing while writing problem.
