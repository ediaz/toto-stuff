\title{Time management}{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
I definitely can optimize my time, I feel I waste time in not urgent/ not important things. I 
am kind of internet addict. In the office sometimes I can be "too social".

 I used past week for my homework, which is not very representative about how I spent my time
in the last 3 months (it was way more relaxed). However, it certainly made me think about
what I could have done to spend my time better. 


I think I can swap must of my not important/not urgent time for stuff I would like to do: like
more exercise and outdoor activities during the week. This time/table is for one week. So it 
does not contain long term projects or activities. I feel is there where I can make the bigger
difference. For instance, I usually delay my writing during the Spring semester (because
I feel is hard for me to write). Then, I have to rush to finish it in a timely manner, making
it urgent and important.



\begin{enumerate}
  \item Reduce internet surfing.
  \item Do a better long term planning for long projects (like writing for instance).
  \item Treat sports as a daily important/not urgent activity. 
  \item Get as empty as possible the urgent boxes (trough better management).
  \item I think allocating daily time frames (using a calendar for instance) can 
        ``force me'' to be more organized. It should be helpful to think in advance
        how I am going to spend my time every day. 
\end{enumerate}
